#For this project, I downloaded a dataset about Spotify from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert the Spotify date into.
#Finally, I used SQL to analyze certain aspects of the data.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL);

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined what the top 10 artists were by popularity.
select artist_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

#Then I found the average danceability and energy of the top ten songs.
select avg(danceability),avg(energy) 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where id<11;

#Finally I found artists who had more than 2 songs on the top charts.
select artist_name,count(artist_name)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
having count(artist_name)>2;
